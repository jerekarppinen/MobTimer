MobTimer
========

An on-screen pop-up timer for Mob Programming. Helps your team to switch drivers periodically.

In Mystes, we initially used timer apps on smart phones to prompt the driver change with an annoying alarm noise. Once we had two mob teams in the same open room, it quickly became clear that we needed a silent but efficient timer for the purpose.

The inspiration for creating MobTimer was seeing how Woody Zuill's team uses a similar tool for forcing driver switch in Mob Programming sessions. Unfortunately we cannot use their original .Net version of the tool because our mobs use various platforms. Thus, we decided to develop our own version of the tool with good ol' Java.

## Using MobTimer

There are no pre-built releases available yet. Building and running from source is quite simple.

In the root directory of the project:

1. Compile and create the JAR
```
javac *.java
jar cfe mobtimer.jar mobtimer *.class
```
2. Run it!
```
java -jar mobtimer.jar
```

Or as a one-liner:
```
javac *.java && jar cfe mobtimer.jar mobtimer *.class && java -jar mobtimer.jar
```

**Once you have the timer up and running, you can use it to schedule driver changes:**
* Change the number of minutes you want each turn to last, for example 15 minutes
* Click the button "NEXT DRIVER - OK GO!"
* The timer automatically minimizes and your driver can start working
* Once the time is up, the timer window will pop up on full-screen and let your team know it's time to switch drivers
* The next timer should step in, and click the "NEXT DRIVER - OK GO!" button again.

## Platforms & Requirements

MobTimer requires Java JRE to work and JDK to build.

MobTimer has been successfully used on these platforms:
- Mac OSX 10.10 with Oracle JRE for Java 1.7
- Ubutntu 14.04 with OpenJDK JRE for Java 1.7

Known problems with platforms & Java versions
- Ubutntu 14.04 with Oracle JRE for Java 1.7 doesn't allow the timer to pop on screen on top of other windows.
 - Workaround: run with OpenJDK JRE

If you test and use MobTimer on other platforms, please let us know which ones and how well it works!

## Releases

- 0.1 - Initial prototype for platform testing

## Roadmap

- 0.2 - Add list of drivers and call automatically for the next timer
